Hey God, I think you owe me a great big apology (Terrible Lie) #NIN #NineInchNails
Hey God, I really don't know what you mean \ Seems like salvation comes only in our dreams (Terrible Lie) #NIN #NineInchNails
You made me throw it all away \ My morals left to decay \ How many you betray \ You've taken everything (Terrible Lie) #NIN #NineInchNails
Kinda like a cloud, I was up, way up in the sky \ And I was feeling some feelings you wouldn't believe  \ Sometimes I don't believe them myself \ And I decided I was never coming down (Down In It) #NIN #NineInchNails
Shut up! So what? What does it matter now? \ I was swimming in the haze, now I crawl on the ground \ And everything I never liked about you \ Is kind of seeping into me (Down In It) #NIN #NineInchNails
And what I used to think was me \ Is just a fading memory \ I looked him right in the eye \ And said goodbye  (Down In It) #NIN #NineInchNails
What if she touches with those fingertips \ As the words spill out like fire from her lips? (Sanctified) #NIN #NineInchNails

I know it's not the right thing \ And I know it's not the good thing (Kinda I Want To) #NIN #NineInchNails
I'm not sure of what I should do \ When every thought I'm thinking of is you (Kinda I Want To) #NIN #NineInchNails
Did you think I wouldn't recognize this compromise? \ Am I just too stupid to realize? \ Stale incense, old sweat, and lies, lies, lies (Sin) #NIN #NineInchNails
You give me the anger \ You give me the nerve \ Carry out my sentence \ While I get what I deserve (Sin) #NIN #NineInchNails
I'm just an effigy to be disgraced \ To be defaced \ Your need for me has been replaced (Sin) #NIN #NineInchNails
You give me the reason \ You give me control \ I gave you my purity \ And my purity you stole (Sin) #NIN #NineInchNails
Now all that I've been hearing must be true \ I guess I'm not the only boy for you (That's What I Get) #NIN #NineInchNails
Why does it come as a surprise? \ To think that I was so naïve \ Maybe didn't mean that much \ But it meant everything to me (That's What I Get) #NIN #NineInchNails
I'm drunk \ And right now I'm so in love with you \ And I don't want to think too much about what we should or shouldn't do (The Only Time) #NIN #NineInchNails
I swear \ I just found everything I need \ The sweat in your eyes, the blood in your veins are listening to me (The Only Time) #NIN #NineInchNails
Maybe I'm all messed up \ Maybe I'm all messed up \ Maybe I'm all messed up in you (The Only Time) #NIN #NineInchNails
Well, you've got me working so hard lately \ Working my hands until they bleed \ If I was twice the man I could be \ I'd still be half of what you need (Ringfinger) #NIN #NineInchNails
Still you lead me and I follow \ Anything you ask you know I'll do \ But this one act of consecration is what I ask of you (Ringfinger) #NIN #NineInchNails
(Ringfinger) \ Promise carved in stone \ Deeper than the sea (Ringfinger) #NIN #NineInchNails
Wrap my eyes in bandages \ Confessions I see through \ I get everything I want \ When I get part of you (Ringfinger) #NIN #NineInchNails
I built it up, now I take it apart \ Climbed up real high, now fall down real far (Wish) #NIN #NineInchNails
No need for me to stay \ The last thing left, I just threw it away (Wish) #NIN #NineInchNails
I put my faith in god and my trust in you \ Now there's nothing more fucked up I could do (Wish) #NIN #NineInchNails
No new tale to tell \ Twenty-six years, on my way to hell (Wish) #NIN #NineInchNails
Gotta listen to your big-time, hard-line, bad luck, fist-fuck (Wish) #NIN #NineInchNails
Wish there was something real \ Wish there was something true \ Wish there was something real \ In this world full of you (Wish) #NIN #NineInchNails
Pigs we get what pigs deserve (Last) #NIN #NineInchNails
