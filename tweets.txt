You made me throw it all away \ My morals left to decay \ How many you betray \ You've taken everything (Terrible Lie) #NIN #NineInchNails
Kinda like a cloud, I was up, way up in the sky \ And I was feeling some feelings you wouldn't believe  \ Sometimes I don't believe them myself \ And I decided I was never coming down (Down In It) #NIN #NineInchNails
Shut up! So what? What does it matter now? \ I was swimming in the haze, now I crawl on the ground \ And everything I never liked about you \ Is kind of seeping into me (Down In It) #NIN #NineInchNails

(Ringfinger) \ Promise carved in stone \ Deeper than the sea (Ringfinger) #NIN #NineInchNails
Wrap my eyes in bandages \ Confessions I see through \ I get everything I want \ When I get part of you (Ringfinger) #NIN #NineInchNails
I built it up, now I take it apart \ Climbed up real high, now fall down real far (Wish) #NIN #NineInchNails
No need for me to stay \ The last thing left, I just threw it away (Wish) #NIN #NineInchNails
I put my faith in god and my trust in you \ Now there's nothing more fucked up I could do (Wish) #NIN #NineInchNails
No new tale to tell \ Twenty-six years, on my way to hell (Wish) #NIN #NineInchNails
Gotta listen to your big-time, hard-line, bad luck, fist-fuck (Wish) #NIN #NineInchNails
