Well you've got me working so hard lately (Ringfinger) #NIN #NineInchNails
God Money I'll do anything for you (Head Like a Hole) #NIN #NineInchNails
My lips may promise but my heart is a whore (Last) #NIN #NineInchNails
God Money don't want everything he wants it all (Head Like a Hole) #NIN #NineInchNails
God Money let's go dancing on the backs of the bruised (Head Like a Hole) #NIN #NineInchNails
Hey God, I think you owe me a great big apology (Terrible Lie) #NIN #NineInchNails
Hey God, I really don't know what you mean \ Seems like salvation comes only in our dreams (Terrible Lie) #NIN #NineInchNails
You made me throw it all away \ My morals left to decay \ How many you betray \ You've taken everything (Terrible Lie) #NIN #NineInchNails
