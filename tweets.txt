Well you've got me working so hard lately (Ringfinger) #NIN #NineInchNails
God Money I'll do anything for you (Head Like a Hole) #NIN #NineInchNails
My lips may promise but my heart is a whore (Last) #NIN #NineInchNails
God Money don't want everything he wants it all (Head Like a Hole) #NIN #NineInchNails
God Money let's go dancing on the backs of the bruised (Head Like a Hole) #NIN #NineInchNails
Hey God, I think you owe me a great big apology (Terrible Lie) #NIN #NineInchNails
Hey God, I really don't know what you mean \ Seems like salvation comes only in our dreams (Terrible Lie) #NIN #NineInchNails
You made me throw it all away \ My morals left to decay \ How many you betray \ You've taken everything (Terrible Lie) #NIN #NineInchNails
Kinda like a cloud, I was up, way up in the sky \ And I was feeling some feelings you wouldn't believe  \ Sometimes I don't believe them myself \ And I decided I was never coming down (Down In It) #NIN #NineInchNails
Shut up! So what? What does it matter now? \ I was swimming in the haze, now I crawl on the ground \ And everything I never liked about you \ Is kind of seeping into me (Down In It) #NIN #NineInchNails
And what I used to think was me \ Is just a fading memory \ I looked him right in the eye \ And said goodbye  (Down In It) #NIN #NineInchNails
What if she touches with those fingertips \ As the words spill out like fire from her lips? (Sanctified) #NIN #NineInchNails
If she says, "Come inside," I'll come inside for her \ If she says, "Give it all," I'll give everything to her (Sanctified) #NIN #NineInchNails
I am justified \ I am purified \ I am sanctified \ Inside you (Sanctified) #NIN #NineInchNails
My favorite dreams of you still wash ashore (Something I Can Never Have) #NIN #NineInchNails
This thing is slowly taking me apart \ Grey would be the color if I had a heart (Something I Can Never Have) #NIN #NineInchNails
Everywhere I look you're all I see \ Just a fading fucking reminder of who I used to be \ Come on, tell me! (Something I Can Never Have) #NIN #NineInchNails
I know it's not the right thing \ And I know it's not the good thing (Kinda I Want To) #NIN #NineInchNails
I'm not sure of what I should do \ When every thought I'm thinking of is you (Kinda I Want To) #NIN #NineInchNails
Did you think I wouldn't recognize this compromise? \ Am I just too stupid to realize? \ Stale incense, old sweat, and lies, lies, lies (Sin) #NIN #NineInchNails
You give me the anger \ You give me the nerve \ Carry out my sentence \ While I get what I deserve (Sin) #NIN #NineInchNails
I'm just an effigy to be disgraced \ To be defaced \ Your need for me has been replaced (Sin) #NIN #NineInchNails
You give me the reason \ You give me control \ I gave you my purity \ And my purity you stole (Sin) #NIN #NineInchNails
Now all that I've been hearing must be true \ I guess I'm not the only boy for you (That's What I Get) #NIN #NineInchNails
Why does it come as a surprise? \ To think that I was so na√Øve \ Maybe didn't mean that much \ But it meant everything to me (That's What I Get) #NIN #NineInchNails
I'm drunk \ And right now I'm so in love with you \ And I don't want to think too much about what we should or shouldn't do (The Only Time) #NIN #NineInchNails
I swear \ I just found everything I need \ The sweat in your eyes, the blood in your veins are listening to me (The Only Time) #NIN #NineInchNails
Maybe I'm all messed up \ Maybe I'm all messed up \ Maybe I'm all messed up in you (The Only Time) #NIN #NineInchNails
Well, you've got me working so hard lately \ Working my hands until they bleed \ If I was twice the man I could be \ I'd still be half of what you need (Ringfinger) #NIN #NineInchNails
Still you lead me and I follow \ Anything you ask you know I'll do \ But this one act of consecration is what I ask of you (Ringfinger) #NIN #NineInchNails
(Ringfinger) \ Promise carved in stone \ Deeper than the sea (Ringfinger) #NIN #NineInchNails
Wrap my eyes in bandages \ Confessions I see through \ I get everything I want \ When I get part of you (Ringfinger) #NIN #NineInchNails
I built it up, now I take it apart \ Climbed up real high, now fall down real far (Wish) #NIN #NineInchNails
No need for me to stay \ The last thing left, I just threw it away (Wish) #NIN #NineInchNails
I put my faith in god and my trust in you \ Now there's nothing more fucked up I could do (Wish) #NIN #NineInchNails
No new tale to tell \ Twenty-six years, on my way to hell (Wish) #NIN #NineInchNails
Gotta listen to your big-time, hard-line, bad luck, fist-fuck (Wish) #NIN #NineInchNails
Wish there was something real \ Wish there was something true \ Wish there was something real \ In this world full of you (Wish) #NIN #NineInchNails
Pigs we get what pigs deserve (Last) #NIN #NineInchNails
This isn't meant to last \ This is for right now (Last) #NIN #NineInchNails
Fresh blood through tired skin \ New sweat to drown me in \ Dress up this rotten carcass just to make it look alive (Last) #NIN #NineInchNails
I want you to make me \ I want you to take me \ I want you to break me \ Then I want you to throw me away (Last) #NIN #NineInchNails
(Slave screams) He hears but doesn't want to listen \ (Slave screams) He's being beat into submission (Happiness in Slavery) #NIN #NineInchNails
Don't open your eyes you won't like what you see \ The devils of truth steal the souls of the free (Happiness in Slavery) #NIN #NineInchNails
(Slave screams) He's going to cause the system to fall \ (Slave screams) But he's glad to be chained to that wall (Happiness in Slavery) #NIN #NineInchNails
Don't open your eyes you won't like what you see \ The blind have been blessed with security \ Don't open your eyes, take it from me \ I have found you can find happiness in slavery (Happiness in Slavery) #NIN #NineInchNails
Stick my hands through the cage of this endless routine \ Just some flesh caught in this big broken machine (Happiness in Slavery) #NIN #NineInchNails
Perfect little dream, the kind that hurts the most \ Forgot how it feels, well almost (Gave Up) #NIN #NineInchNails
Smashed up my sanity \ Smashed up integrity \ Smashed up what I believed in \ Smashed up what's left of me (Gave Up) #NIN #NineInchNails
Smashed up my everything \ Smashed up all that was true \ Gonna smash myself to pieces \ I don't know what else to do (Gave Up) #NIN #NineInchNails
Covered in hope and Vaseline \ Still cannot fix this broken machine \ Watching the hole, it used to be mine \ Just watching it burn in my steady systematic decline (Gave Up) #NIN #NineInchNails
Of the trust I will betray \ Give it to me, I throw it away \ After everything I've done I hate myself for what I've become (Gave Up) #NIN #NineInchNails
I want to date you maybe \ I want to take you out \ I want to wine and dine you \ Oh I want to twist and twist and shout (Physical) #NIN #NineInchNails
All that was true is left behind \ Once I could see, now I am blind \ Don't want your dreams you try to sell \ This disease I give to myself (Suck) #NIN #NineInchNails
She makes it sweeter than the sun \ I get too tight I come undone \ I bow my head to confess \ The temple walls are made of flesh (Suck) #NIN #NineInchNails
A thousand lips \ A thousand tongues \ A thousand throats \ A thousand lungs \ A thousand ways to make it true \ I want to do terrible things to you (Suck) #NIN #NineInchNails
I take you where you want to go \ I give you all you need to know \ I drag you down, I use you up \ Mr. Self Destruct (Mr. Self Destruct) #NIN #NineInchNails
I speak religion's message clear \ (And I control you) \ I am denial, guilt, and fear \ (And I control you) (Mr. Self Destruct) #NIN #NineInchNails
All of my fears came true \ Black and blue and broken bones \ You left me here, I'm all alone \ My little piggy needed something new (Piggy) #NIN #NineInchNails
Hey pig \ Nothing's turning out the way I planned \ Hey pig \ There's a lot of things I hoped you could help me understand (Piggy) #NIN #NineInchNails
What am I supposed to do? \ Lost my shit because of you (Piggy) #NIN #NineInchNails
God is dead and no one cares \ If there is a hell I'll see you there (Heresy) #NIN #NineInchNails
He flexed his muscles to keep his flock of sheep in line \ He made a virus that would kill off all the swine \ His perfect kingdom of killing, suffering and pain \ Demands devotion atrocities done in his name (Heresy) #NIN #NineInchNails
