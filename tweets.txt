Well you've got me working so hard lately (Ringfinger)
God Money I'll do anything for you (Head Like a Hole)
My lips may promise but my heart is a whore (Last)
God Money don't want everything he wants it all (Head Like a Hole)
God Money let's go dancing on the backs of the bruised (Head Like a Hole)
Hey God, I think you owe me a great big apology (Terrible Lie)
Hey God, I really don't know what you mean\nSeems like salvation comes only in our dreams (Terrible Lie)
You made me throw it all away\mMy morals left to decay\nHow many you betray\nYou've taken everything (Terrible Lie)
